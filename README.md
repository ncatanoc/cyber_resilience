# Program Synthesis for Cyber-Resilience
## Nestor Catano (nestor.catano@gmail.com)

This repository shows our work on program synthesis for cyber-resilience. We show how program synthesis techniques can be used to produce **certified code** for architectural tactics. Our work is based on **Event-B formal methods** and the EventB2Java code generator tool. We show how **testing** techiques can be used to animate and check the behaviour of the generated code to check if its behaviour meets our expectations.  

Here is a list of files included in this repository.

**availability_exception.zip** Event-B model for the *exception* architectural tactic (availability). You can import it from Rodin 3.3 via File, Import, Existing Project into Work Space.

**availability_heartbeat.zip** Event-B model for *heartbeat* architectural tactic (availability). You can import it from Rodin 3.3 via File, Import, Existing Project into Work Space.

**availability_pingecho.zip** Event-B model for *pingecho* architectural tactic (availability). You can import it from Rodin 3.3 via File, Import, Existing Project into Work Space.

**availability_timestamp.zip** Event-B model for the *timestamp* architectural tactic (availability). You can import it from Rodin 3.3 via File, Import, Existing Project into Work Space.

**performance_limit_epriority.zip** Event-B model for the *priority* architectural tactic (performance). You can import it from Rodin 3.3 via File, Import, Existing Project into Work Space.

**performance_limit_eresponse.zip** Event-B model for the *response* architectural tactic (performance). You can import it from Rodin 3.3 via File, Import, Existing Project into Work Space.

**performance_limit_access.zip** Event-B model for the *access control* architectural tactic (security). You can import it from Rodin 3.3 via File, Import, Existing Project into Work Space.
